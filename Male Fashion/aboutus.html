                      <p class="card-text">1. Always look at the trends
                        These trends have different meanings.
                        
                        The first trend you need to look up is the numbers. It means the demands, market value, booming business models, strategies other brand owners use, etc.
                        
                        The next trend is the products themselves. Since the fashion industry is fast-paced, especially with social media... You need to keep up with the design trends in fashion.
                        
                        This way, you'll know which clothes to make or source for modern fashion consumers. The next thing you need to do is...
                      
                         <br>
                        
                        2. Embrace social selling
                        Social selling is well-known in the fashion industry. There are big and small fashion brands going live on TikTok to sell... Integrating their socials to their eCommerce website... and more.
                        
                        You need to use social media to your advantage. That's how you can reach more people, connect with your target customers, and increase your retail eCommerce sales.
                        
                        Some social media platforms you use are:
                        <br>
                        Facebook
                        <br>
                        Instagram
                        <br>
                        But in social media marketing, it's important to note which platforms your customers are using. Why? So you can reach the right people.
                        
                        And last but very important...
                        
                         <br>
                        
                        3. Optimize for customer experience
                        <br>
                        Customer experience should be one of your top priorities... Because if a customer has a smooth experience during their transaction with you, they'll return.
                        
                        So, what should you do? One thing is to optimize for mobile shopping. Many online shops do this, too. Why?
                        
                        Because some consumers prefer ordering through their mobile phones... It's more convenient. You might lose potential customers if your online store is not optimized for mobile.
                        
                        The next one is to find a smooth-sailing theme. There are many eCommerce themes available in the market. But it's best to find an eCommerce tailored to the fashion industry.
                        
                        Another way is to check your web pages, like your checkout page. Is it easy to use? Can the customers check out without any hassle?
                        
                        If you make your customers' lives easier when transacting with you, you will increase your online sales more easily.
                        <br>
                        What are you waiting for?
                        <br>
                         
                        Enhance your fashion eCommerce brand with these strategies!
                        <br>
                        Building and enhancing your fashion brand takes a lot of work. You want to make sure your products will sell and customers will come back for your products.
